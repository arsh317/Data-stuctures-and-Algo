/* 
Assign Mice to Holes
There are N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line. Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse. 
A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1.
Any of these moves consumes 1 minute. Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a
hole is minimized.
